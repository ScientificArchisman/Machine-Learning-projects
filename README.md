# Machine-Learning-projects
This repository is connected to my Machine Learning project and contains all the sub projects I did as an undergraduate student on Machine Learning using Python

# Project 1: Linear Regression
This is the first project on machine learning.
I involves work done on a hypothetical data set of a company.
The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis of this data and using Linear regression to make predictions and analysis on this data.
The libraries used are:
1. numpy
2. Scikit learn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib.pyplot
5. Seaborn.

# Project 2: Logistic Regression
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.
We have used the Logistic Reggression model from sklearn linear model family for this project.
The main libraries which have been used are:
- numpy
- scikit learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
The model has a precision of 92.5, an F1-scrore of 92.5 and a recall of 92.5 as well.

# Project 3: Support Vector Machines
In this project we will be working with the famous iris dataset. We will try to create a model that will predict the type of the flower.
We have used the SVM model from sklearn SVM family for this project.
The main libraries which have been used are:
- numpy
- scikit learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
The model has a precision of 1.00, an F1-scrore of 1.00 and a recall of 1.00 as wel
