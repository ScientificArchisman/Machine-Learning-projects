# Machine-Learning-projects
This repository is connected to my Machine Learning project and contains all the sub projects I did as an undergraduate student on Machine Learning using Python

# Project 1: Linear Regression
This is the first project on machine learning.
I involves work done on a hypothetical data set of a company.
The project involves Exploratory Data Analysis of this data and using Linear regression to make predictions and analysis on this data.
The libraries used are:
1. numpy
2. Scikit learn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib.pyplot
5. Seaborn.
